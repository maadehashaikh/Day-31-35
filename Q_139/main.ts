// Question 139: List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each.
// Explain & TIP: Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and make your code more readable.

let item :string = "mango is love";  // let is reserve word
console.log(item); // console is reserve word
let i=0;
while(i<item.length){  // while is reserve word
  console.log(item[i]);
  i++;
}
